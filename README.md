- **Bank Contract** ‚Äì Takes care of user deposits, withdrawals and interest claims in sepolia ETH.
- **FeeCollector Contract** ‚Äì The feeCollector contracts receives deposit fees from the Bank contract, a source of interest payment.

> Both Contracts simulates a banking system where users can receive interests on their deposits.

## Contracts Overview
**Bank.sol**
- Accepts deposits in ether
- Deducts a defined fee percent and sneds it to the feeCollector contract
- Tracks balances and deposit timestamps of users.
- Distributes interest based on a defined APR.

- Pause and unpause Bank
- Assign role to subordinates
- Revoke roles for subordinates
- Renounce their roles
- The Default Admin(owner) can change ownership to a new address.
- Re-configure bank key parameters if they have such privileges <br>

**FeeCollector.sol** <br>
- Receives and holds ether
- Can Send Interest to the Bank Contract for interest payouts
